            My name is Thi Kieu Trinh Vu and I just recently graduated from
            Seneca Polytechnic.
          </p>

          <p>
            I have completed a two-year program in Computer Programming with
            enthusiasm and passion. I take pride in the knowledge and skills I
            have acquired throughout my time in school, and I am eager to apply
            them in a junior role. I am ready to face challenges and learn to
            become a proactive contributor to the team. Looking forward to
            working with colleagues in the future.
